##  Accelerometer Activity Data
####  [Actigraph GTX-9](https://theactigraph.com/actigraph-link)

    40 subjects (16 male, 24 female) completed 5 activities with accelerometer sensors on their waist, wrist, and shank (ankle).
    
    Activities: walking sidewalk - natural pace, upstairs, downstairs, walking treadmill - 2.5 mph, jogging treadmill - 5.5 mph

##  Smart Shirt Data

#### [Hexoskin Smart Shirt](https://www.hexoskin.com/collections/kits/products/hexoskin-smart-kit-mens)   
    A subset of subjects wore a Hexoskin smart shirt while performing activities. Shirts collected acceleration, repiratory rate, and heart rate.

##  Biometrics Data
#### [Biometrics Visualizations](https://github.com/Har-Lab/HumanActivityData/blob/main/implementations/biometrics.ipynb)

    All subjects were assessed with 13 quantitative biometrics and 5 qualitative biometrics. Subjects were recruited from Loyola Marymount's campus.
